excerpt: ' People with dementia have pre-reactive instincts, known as bodily habits, that allow them
to continue with habitual activities. According to recent research, continuing and developing habitual
activities in care facilities can help individuals with dementia establish a deep-rooted sense of home.
Three aspects of developing habitual activity are critical in this process: continuing habitual activities
fluidly, incorporating positive interaction into these habitual activities, and carrying out these habitual
activities regularly. Based on this foundation, this article discusses how the interior environment of
care facilities can support these three aspects of habitual activity for people living with dementia.
Three cases in a long-term care facility were in-depth examined by using the microethnography
approach. The study produced four themes. These themes emphasize the importance of organizing
and managing the interior environment to support dementia residentsâ€™ habitual activities. In addition,
it emphasizes that caregivers and institutional regulations influence the organizational role of the
interior environment.'
